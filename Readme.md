This is a folder which I try to do basic cmake stuff to get a better understanding of how things work using C++

Things that are done here:

- Running Tests with ctest
- linking headers to source 
- linking libraries from different folders
- install and using libraries in other folders "/testinclude" and "/testlib"

Cmake commands used:

- target_link_libraries
- add_test and enable_testing
- add_executable
- add_library
- target_include_directories
- message
- set
